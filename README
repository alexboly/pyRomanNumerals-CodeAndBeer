This is the Roman numerals kata solved in python during the Code And Beer AgileWorks Bucharest event from December 2012.

I paired for it with a tester and a circuit design specialist, so it was quite a fun experience.

Note: I am learning python so any suggestion to make it more pythonesque is welcome.
